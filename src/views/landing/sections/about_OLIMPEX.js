                                    We are a multidisciplinary group of Argentinian students who live in the province of Mendoza, in the proximity of the Andean range. Due to the water crisis weâ€™ve been facing since 2010, we live the consequences of climate change everyday and this is what inspired us to help others understand the role of water in our lives and how our future depends on us.
